# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Build a Hand Gesture Recognition model using a "Hand Gesture Recognition" Database from Kaggle

Train a Machine Learning model for classifying images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, showing the thumb, and others using CNN layers.


## Context
Hand gesture recognition database is presented, composed by a set of near infrared images acquired by the Leap Motion sensor.

## Content:
The database is composed by 10 different hand-gestures (showed above) that were performed by 10 different subjects (5 men and 5 women).
